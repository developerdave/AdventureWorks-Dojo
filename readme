The AdventureWorks sample databases are for the ficticious AdventureWorks -- a large, multinational manufacturing company. 
"The company manufactures and sells metal and composite bicycles to North American, European and Asian commercial markets. 
While its base operation is located in Bothell, Washington with 290 employees, several regional sales teams are located throughout 
their market base. In 2000, Adventure Works Cycles bought a small manufacturing plant, Importadores Neptuno, located in Mexico. 
Importadores Neptuno manufactures several critical subcomponents for the Adventure Works Cycles product line. These subcomponents 
are shipped to the Bothell location for final product assembly. In 2001, Importadores Neptuno became the sole manufacturer 
and distributor of the touring bicycle product group. Coming off a successful fiscal year, Adventure Works Cycles is looking to 
broaden its market share by targeting their sales to their best customers, extending their product availability through an external 
Web site, and reducing their cost of sales through lower production costs." 

The dojo uses the AdeventureWorksLT database available from http://msftdbprodsamples.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=AWLTDocs&ProjectName=msftdbprodsamples

The AdventureWorksLT database is based on the Adventure Works Cycles scenario, the purpose of the AdventureWorksLT database is to provide
a simple, small database sample focused on a product sales scenario.

AventureWorksLT is simpler in the following ways:
* The schema design is denormalised compared with AdventureWorks. 
* The quantity of data is reduced from 180mb down to 7mb.
* Instead of 5 schemas plus dbo in the database, AdventureWorksLT has one schema plus dbo in the database.
* Instead of 70 tables, AdventureWorksLT has 12 tables.
